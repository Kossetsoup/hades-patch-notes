# The Long Winter Update v0.24897

This page collates all the combat-related changes to Hades which were released in the Long Winter update. This inlcudes buffs, nerfs, new boons, hammer upgrades and combat related contractor material.

I did my best to make sure this was all correct and accurate but it could be wrong still, please contact me (Kossetsu#7660 on Discord) if you have any questions or would like to raise a correction.

Firstly, here's some important info!

## Important Stuff

### Boon Rarity

Boon rarity multipliers follow a standard multiplier range, unless otherwise specified. If the Rarity Multiplier is marked as *Standard*, then it uses the following multipliers:

| Common | Rare | Epic | Heroic |
| - | - | - | - |
| 1.0 | 1.3 ~ 1.5 | 1.8 ~ 2.0 | 2.3 ~ 2.5 |

The standard multiplier chooses a random number within these ranges to use as the multiplier for that particular Boon for the run, but Boons where the multipliers are defined are usually constant.

Rarities written are written as the multiplier for "Common / Rare / Epic / Heroic" respectively. Multipliers are not applicable to every Boon, such as Duos and Legendaries.

If a '-' is written for a particular Rarity or the entire column, it means that particular Rarity cannot be reached and therefore has no multiplier, or the Boon is not modified by Rarity because it cannot be (Duo, Legendary).

### Poms

When boons are upgraded by Poms, they are upgraded by a percentage based on the previous upgrade. There are a couple of standard multipliers that Boons are upgraded by: *Standard* and *Strong*. Some Boons have unique Pom multipliers which are expressed as a negative multiplier. The following are the stanrdard Pom multipliers:

| Standard | Strong |
| - | - |
| -60% | -40% |

This means that if a Boon has a *Standard* Pom multiplier, the first level you give it, it will be 60% less effective than the initial value. Here's an example:

> If you had a boon which dealt 100 damage at base and had a *Standard* Pom mulitplier, at level 2 it will deal 140 damage, as 40% of 100 (40) is added to the value. Then at level 3 it will deal 156 damage, as 40% of the previous value, 40, is added to the value, therefore adding 16.

If a Pom Multiplier is listed as '-', then that Boon cannot be upgraded.

Boons can have their returns from Poms from diminish quickly, so be smart about leveling them! Anyway! ~
